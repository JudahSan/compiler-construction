Half Adder: adds two bits
-


A half adder is a basic digital circuit that adds two binary digits (bits) and produces a sum and a carry. It has two inputs, A and B, representing the bits to be added, and two outputs, Sum (S) and Carry (C). The half adder can handle the addition of individual bits but cannot account for any carry from previous addition operations.

|a|b|sum|carry|
|-|-|---|-----|
|0|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|0|
|1|0|1|0
|1|1|0|1

```asm
CHIP HalfAdder {
    IN a, b;    // 1-bit inputs
    OUT sum,    // Right bit of a + b 
        carry;  // Left bit of a + b

    PARTS:
    // Put you code here:
    Xor(a=a, b=b, out=sum);
    And(a=a, b=b, out=carry);
}
```

Full Adder: adds three bits
-

A full adder is an extension of the half adder that includes an additional input, the carry input (Cin), which takes into account the carry generated by previous addition operations. In addition to the A and B inputs, a full adder has three outputs: Sum (S), Carry (Cout), and a carry output to be propagated to the next stage of the addition.

|a|b|c|sum|carry|
|-|-|-|---|-----|
|0|0|0|0|0|
|0|0|1|1|0|
|0|1|0|1|0|
|0|1|1|0|1|
|1|0|0|1|0|
|1|0|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|0|1|
|1|1|1|1|1|


```
CHIP FullAdder {
    IN a, b, c;  // 1-bit inputs
    OUT sum,     // Right bit of a + b + c
        carry;   // Left bit of a + b + c

    PARTS:
    // Put you code here:
    HalfAdder(a=a, b=b, sum=half_sum,carry=half_carry);
    HalfAdder(a=half_sum, b=c, sum=sum, carry=c1);
    Or(a=half_carry, b=c1, out=carry);
}
```




Adder: adds two numbers
-

An adder is a more complex circuit that combines multiple full adders to add multi-bit binary numbers. It typically consists of cascaded full adders, with each full adder taking care of a specific bit position. The carry output (Cout) of one full adder is connected as the carry input (Cin) of the next full adder, enabling the addition of multiple bits and accounting for any carries generated during the process.

- 16-bit adder


- out = a + b, as 16-bit integers(overflow ignored)

```
CHIP Inc16 {
    IN in[16];
    OUT out[16];

    PARTS:
   // Put you code here:
   Add16(a=in, b[0]=true, b[1..16]=false, out=out);
}
```
